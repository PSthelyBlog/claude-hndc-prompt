PROGRAM: matrix_multiply_2x2
Description: Multiplies two 2x2 matrices
Expected inputs: Matrix A as a11,a12,a21,a22; Matrix B as b11,b12,b21,b22
---
# Calculate result matrix C = A Ã— B
# c11 = a11*b11 + a12*b21
COMPUTE mul $a11 $b11 -> $temp1
COMPUTE mul $a12 $b21 -> $temp2
COMPUTE add $temp1 $temp2 -> $c11

# c12 = a11*b12 + a12*b22
COMPUTE mul $a11 $b12 -> $temp1
COMPUTE mul $a12 $b22 -> $temp2
COMPUTE add $temp1 $temp2 -> $c12

# c21 = a21*b11 + a22*b21
COMPUTE mul $a21 $b11 -> $temp1
COMPUTE mul $a22 $b21 -> $temp2
COMPUTE add $temp1 $temp2 -> $c21

# c22 = a21*b12 + a22*b22
COMPUTE mul $a21 $b12 -> $temp1
COMPUTE mul $a22 $b22 -> $temp2
COMPUTE add $temp1 $temp2 -> $c22

# Store result matrix
MEMORY store c11 $c11
MEMORY store c12 $c12
MEMORY store c21 $c21
MEMORY store c22 $c22

RETURN "Matrix multiplication complete"
