PROGRAM: compound_interest
Description: Calculates compound interest A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
Expected inputs: $principal, $rate, $compounds_per_year, $years
---
# Convert percentage rate to decimal if needed
IF $rate > 1 THEN
  COMPUTE div $rate 100 -> $rate
ENDIF

# Calculate (1 + r/n)
COMPUTE div $rate $compounds_per_year -> $rate_per_period
COMPUTE add 1 $rate_per_period -> $growth_factor

# Calculate nt (total number of compounds)
COMPUTE mul $compounds_per_year $years -> $total_compounds

# Calculate final amount
COMPUTE pow $growth_factor $total_compounds -> $multiplier
COMPUTE mul $principal $multiplier -> $final_amount

# Calculate interest earned
COMPUTE sub $final_amount $principal -> $interest_earned

MEMORY store final_amount $final_amount
MEMORY store interest_earned $interest_earned
RETURN $final_amount
